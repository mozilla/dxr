"""An extractor of boolean trigram queries from a regex, such that a superset
of the docs matching the regex are returned. You can then run the actual regex
over just the returned docs, saving a lot of computation and IO.

We support a subset of the PCRE regex language at the moment, lacking
lookarounds and noncapturing parens. We can add those later after we decide
the consequences they have for substring extraction. We may be selective about
what we support in order to avoid regex-based DOS attacks, but, aside from
that, DXR's flavor of regex should approach some more popular flavor as
closely as possible.

Junghoo Ch and Sridhar Rajagopalan, in "A fast regular expression indexing
engine", descibe an intuitive method for accelerating regex searching with a
trigram index. This is roughly an implementation of that.

Russ Cox, in http://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp4.html, refines
that to {(1) extract use from runs of less than 3 static chars and (2) extract
trigrams that cross the boundaries between subexpressions} by keeping track of
prefix and suffix information while chewing through a pattern and effectively
merging adjacent subpatterns. This is a direction we may go in the future.
