    A Plugin is an indexer, skimmer, filter set, and other miscellany meant to
    be used together; it is the deployer-visible unit of pluggability. In other
    words, there is no way to subdivide a plugin via configuration; there would
    be no sense running a plugin's filters if the indexer that was supposed to
    extract the requisite data never ran.

    If the deployer should be able to independently enable parts of your
    plugin, consider exposing those as separate plugins.

    Note that Plugins may be instantiated multiple times; don't assume
    otherwise.

            Since a FILE-domain query will
            be promoted to a LINE query if any other query term triggers a
            line-based query, it's important to keep field names and semantics
            the same between lines and files. In other words, a LINE mapping
            should generally be a superset of a FILE mapping.

            definitions for the elasticsearch mappings. A dict with keys

            have a ``direct_search_priority`` attribute. Filters are tried in
            order of increasing priority. Return None from a direct searcher
