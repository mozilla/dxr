This directory is copied up to the container, and is set as the WORKDIR.
So if you run `dxr index`, that happens here.

Usage of the docker environment:
Put a dxr.config and source code directory here.

Run an elasticsearch docker container, and expose port 8000.
docker run --name es -p 80:8000 elasticsearch

Remark: By default the elasticsearch container does not support javascript
queries, which DXR uses -- regexp searches will fail unless you rebuild the
elasticsearch container with an updated config file.

In the parent (repository root):
docker build -t dxr .
docker run --net container:es dxr index
docker run --net container:es dxr serve -a
