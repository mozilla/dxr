# A Data Volume Container to persist any code you might care to index. On a
# Linux host, you can squirrel away code in the shared "dxr" source checkout,
# but, on a Mac, /code will be more attractive because it offers better IO
# performance than VirtualBox's shared folder implementation.

# A Data Volume Container so we don't lose our whole virtualenv and need to
# re-download all the Python packages every time the dev image is rebuilt
