"""Continuous deployment script for DXR

Glossary
========

build directory - A folder, typically in the ``builds`` folder, containing
    these folders...

    dxr - A checkout of the DXR source code
    target - A symlink to the instance to serve
    virtualenv - A virtualenv with DXR and its dependencies installed

    Builds are named after an excerpt of their git hashes and are symlinked
    into the base directory.

base directory - The folder containing these folders...

    builds - A folder of builds, including the current production and staging
        ones
    dxr-prod - A symlink to the current production build
    dxr-staging - A symlink to the current staging build
    instances - A folder of DXR instances organized according to format version

# When we need to make this work across multiple nodes:
# I really have no reason to use Commander over Fabric: I don't need Chief, and
# nearly all the features and conveniences Commander had over Fabric have been
# since implemented in Fabric. Fabric has more features and more support and
# was released more recently. OTOH, Fabric's argument conventions are crazy.

# TODO: Update the deployment script first, and use the new version to deploy.
# That way, each version is deployed by the deployment script that ships with
# it.
