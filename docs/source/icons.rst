Icon Credits
============

DXR uses third-party icons from a variety of sources.

If you add an icon, please document its origin in this document. Feel free to
use existing icons, but keep in mind that they use semantic naming. So don't
use the ``search`` icon for zoom, as we may later change the search icon from a
magnifying glass to, for example, binoculars.
