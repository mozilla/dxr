============================
Welcome To The DXR Community
============================

Though DXR got its start at Mozilla, it's seen contributions from a variety of
companies and individuals around the world. We welcome contributions of code,
bug reports, and helpful feedback.


Bug Reports
===========

Did something explode? Not act as you expected? `Let us know
<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Webtools&component=DXR>`__.


Submitting Patches
==================

To contribute code, just file a `pull request
<https://github.com/mozilla/dxr/compare/>`__. Include tests to double your
chances of getting it merged and qualify for a free Bundt cake. We love tests.
Bundt cake isn't bad, either.


IRC
===

We hang out in the #static channel of irc.mozilla.org. Poke your head in and
say hello.

If you have questions, please address them to the public channel; don't /msg
someone in particular. That way, more people have a chance at answering your
question, and more people can benefit from hearing the answers. We realize
that no one likes looking naive, but please be brave and set an example to
embolden the less-brave naive people. We're a friendly bunch and will never
deride anyone for being a beginner.


Open Bugs
=========

Looking for something to hack on? Here are...

* `Our easy bugs <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=whiteboard%3Aeasy%20component%3ADXR&list_id=6127603>`__
* `All our bugs <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?order=Importance&resolution=---&query_format=advanced&component=DXR&product=Webtools>`__

Before starting work on a bug, hop into the IRC channel and confirm it's still
relevant. We try to garden our bugs, but DXR often moves faster than we can
weed.


Wiki
====

The `wiki <https://wiki.mozilla.org/DXR>`__ is full of roadmap documents,
sketches toward future features, and bikeshedding sessions. Feel free to
scribble on it.
