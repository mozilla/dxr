It is a\ndirect port of the Python-powered [jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/)\ntemplating engine and aims to be feature-complete with jinja2.\n\nIt was born out of frustration with other javascript templating\nengines. The most popular ones either are ugly and don't abstract\nenough (EJS) or have too different of a syntax (Jade).\n\nThe only other project like this is\n[jinjs](https://github.com/ravelsoft/node-jinjs), which seems to have\nbeen abandoned. The code is also not Javascript, but Coco, is\ndifficult to work on, has bugs, and is missing features. Nunjucks\nhopes to be a robust, pure javascript, and easily extended port of\njinja2.\n\n## Installation\n\n`npm install nunjucks`\n\nThe current version is v0.1.9 ([changelog](https://github.com/jlongster/nunjucks/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md))\n\n## Documentation\n\nSee http://nunjucks.jlongster.com/ for complete documentation.\n\nRun all the tests at http://jlongster.github.io/nunjucks/tests/browser/.\n\n## Mailing List\n\nJoin our mailing list and get help with and issues you have: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/nunjucks\n\n## Contributors\n\nhttps://github.com/jlongster/nunjucks/graphs/contributors",
